# Template-Engine Assignment

Created a Team profile generator that uses inputs from prompts to create a dynamic HTML page displaying your teams information on individual cards for each employee you create. This information includes the employee's names, their position, employee ID's, Emails, a managers office number, and engineers GitHub username, and an interns current school they are attending.

## Applications/Technologies Used
This was created using serveral node modules, including Jest (for testing), path, fs, and inquirer.
Once the prompts for each have been created, we use jest to run them through our test files to ensure that all of our inputs are being properly accounted for on all pages.
